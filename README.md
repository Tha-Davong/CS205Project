MATRIX LIBRARY

FUNCTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWED
1) all matrix sizes, from small fixed-size matrices to arbitrarily large dense matrices, and even sparse matrices
2) all standard numeric types, including std::complex, integers, and is easily extensible to custom numeric types. 
3) matrix and vector arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, scalar division, transposition, conjugation, element-wise multiplication, matrix-matrix multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication, dot product and cross product.
4) basic arithmetic reduction operations, including finding the maximum value, finding the minimum value, summing all items, calculating the average value (all supporting axis-specific and all items).
5) computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, calculating traces, computing inverse and computing determinant.
6) the operations of reshape and slicing. 
7) convolutional operations of two matrices.
8) transfer the matrix from OpenCV to the matrix of this library and vice versa.
9) process likely exceptions.
